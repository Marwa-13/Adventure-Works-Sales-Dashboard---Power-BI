Adventure Works Sales Dashboard â€“ Power BI | SQL Server + SSMS

This project showcases the design and development of an interactive sales dashboard for the Adventure Works dataset using Power BI and SQL Server:
  * Data Source: Imported data from SQL Server (SSMS) using SQL views to retrieve relevant sales-related tables.
  * Data Cleaning: Cleaned and transformed the imported data using Power Query, handling missing values and ensuring data integrity.
  * Date Table: Created a dynamic date table using DAX, enabling robust time-based analysis and reporting.
  * Data Modeling: Modeled the data into a star schema for optimal performance and accurate relationships between fact and dimension tables.
  * Hierarchies: Built both product and date hierarchies to allow users to drill into more detailed levels of analysis.
  * DAX Measures: Constructed a dedicated measures table with key DAX calculations for sales metrics such as total sales, total shipping, and number of orders.
  * Interactivity:
    - Enabled drill-downs, drill-through pages, and tooltip for deeper data exploration.
    - Used Bookmarks to create guided navigation and toggle between views or highlight insights.
  * Dashboard: Delivered a visually engaging, fully interactive dashboard that highlights trends, regional performance, and product-level insights.

This project emphasizes skills in SQL, Power BI data modeling, DAX, Power Query, and advanced dashboard interactivity features for professional business intelligence reporting.
